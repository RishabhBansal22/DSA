Great choice, Rishabh! Here’s a hand-picked **starter pack of basic two-pointer problems on arrays**, designed to **build your intuition** step by step.

## ✅ **Basic Two-Pointer Problems (Array)**

### 🔹 1. **Reverse an Array**

**Problem**: Reverse the elements of an array in-place.

```python
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

🧠 **Concept**: Two pointers from both ends, swap elements.

---

### 🔹 2. **Check if Array is Palindrome**

**Problem**: Check if an array reads the same forwards and backwards.

```python
Input: [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
Output: True
```

🧠 **Concept**: Compare `left` and `right` until they meet.

---

### 🔹 3. **Remove a Specific Element In-Place**

**Problem**: Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

```python
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2 → nums = [2,2]
```

🧠 **Concept**: Use two pointers: one to scan, one to write.

---

### 🔹 4. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**

**Problem**: Given a sorted array, remove duplicates in-place.

```python
Input: [1, 1, 2]
Output: 2 → [1, 2]
```

🧠 **Concept**: Two pointers — one slow (unique tracker), one fast (scanner).

---

### 🔹 5. **Find Two Numbers That Sum to Target (Sorted)**

**Problem**: Given a sorted array, find two numbers such that they sum to a target.

```python
Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6], target = 7
Output: [1, 4]  # 1-based indices
```

🧠 **Concept**: Start one pointer from left, one from right, move based on sum.

---

### 🔹 6. **Move Zeroes to End**

**Problem**: Move all zeroes to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.

```python
Input: [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]
```

🧠 **Concept**: One pointer to track position of non-zero values.

---

### 🔹 7. **Sorted Squares of a Sorted Array**

**Problem**: Given a sorted array, return a new array of squares of each number, also sorted.

```python
Input: [-4, -1, 0, 3, 10]
Output: [0, 1, 9, 16, 100]
```

🧠 **Concept**: Use two pointers from both ends and fill from end of result array.
